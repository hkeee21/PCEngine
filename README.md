## PCEngine
PCEngine is an efficient **Engine** for sparse convolution inference in 3D **P**oint **C**louds. Generally, PCEngine proposes techniques including a novel CSR-coded mapping format, an indicator-assisted FGMS (Fused Gather-Matmul-Scatter) fusion scheme and an adaptive dataflow to improve sparse convolution inference performance.

## News
[2023.05.01] The code will be released soon.
